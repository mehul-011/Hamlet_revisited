  <h2>N70 — Branching Deaths</h2>

  <p>This node is a tangle of alternate timelines.</p>

  <p>1. Ophelia does not drown. She drops the flowers and leaves.<br>
     2. Hamlet does not hesitate. Claudius never finishes his prayer.<br>
     3. Nobody dies, but the Ghost keeps refreshing your page.<br>
     4. Everyone dies, as in the original, because you followed the canonical links.</p>

  <p>Which script do you let the system execute?</p>

  <div class="choices">
    <a href="N80_original.html">Follow the canonical tragedy</a>
    <a href="N80_variant.html">Protect Ophelia at all costs</a>
    <a href="N70a.html">Refuse all deaths, no matter how the text protests</a>
