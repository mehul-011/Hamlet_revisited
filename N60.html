  <h2>N60 — Surveillance Logs</h2>

  <p>Tiled screens. Everywhere is Elsinore, but no one knows they’re being watched by you.</p>

  <p>CAM_01: Hallway North – Hamlet passes, speaking to air.<br>
     CAM_02: Queen’s chamber – Gertrude’s silhouette, two glasses on the table.<br>
     CAM_03: River – static, occasionally a white flicker: dress? flower? glitch?</p>

  <p>A log in Polonius’s tone, time-stamped:</p>
  <p>13:07 – Subject: Ophelia. Recommend further observation.<br>
     14:22 – Subject: Hamlet. Language increasingly fragmented.<br>
     14:59 – Subject: YOU. Presence detected.</p>

  <p><code>UNAUTHORIZED VIEWER DETECTED. CHOICES WILL BE LOGGED.</code></p>
