  <p>Static, then: a silhouette assembles from stray characters. The Ghost is a bad connection to the past.</p>

  <p>"I was killed between one frame and the next.<br>
     Poison in the ear, yes, but also deleted logs, overwritten cameras, scrubbed metadata."</p>

  <p><em>"I am thy father's spirit,<br>
     Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night…"</em></p>

  <div class="choices">
    <a href="N20.html">Accept the command to revenge</a>
    <a href="N40.html">Try to remember instead of obey</a>
    <a href="N60.html">Peek in on the court, unseen</a>
  </div>
