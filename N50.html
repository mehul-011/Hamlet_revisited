  <h2>N50 — Play Within the Play</h2>

  <p>An embedded stage appears: a small window within your own.</p>

  <p>Actors speak in tags:</p>
  <p>&lt;actor name="PLAYER KING"&gt;I did kill thee once, but only in the script.&lt;/actor&gt;<br>
     &lt;actor name="PLAYER QUEEN"&gt;We are puppets until the reader looks away.&lt;/actor&gt;</p>

  <p>The king will reveal himself if you click the wrong line.</p>

  <div class="choices">
    <a href="N70.html">Accuse the king openly in front of everyone</a>
    <a href="N60.html">Keep watching and taking notes</a>
    <a href="N70a.html">Rewrite the scene so that nobody dies</a>
