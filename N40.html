  <h2>N40 — The Mirror Stage (YOU)</h2>

  <p>A blank screen. Then your own cursor appears, but the system types for you:</p>
  <p><strong>YOU ARE NOT NEUTRAL.</strong></p>

     whose body is allowed to become a metaphor.</p>

  <p>You can still pretend, but the log says otherwise.</p>

  <div class="choices">
    <a href="N60.html">Pretend you are only reading</a>
    <a href="N70.html">Admit you are choosing lives</a>
    <a href="N80a.html">Step away from the machine</a>
    <a href="index.html">Return to login</a>
